            Women have always been known to have great intuition, especially when it comes to their body reacting to
            certain conditions - emotionally, mentally or physically.

            These “feelings” tend to get “out of control” during specific phases of our life, the kind that we see in movies but
            have not explicitly discussed before it happens.

            We start to sense a shift in the way our body works; drastic mood swings with frequent tears or outbursts.
            The worst part?

            The way people start reacting to this outburst, responding like they think we are going crazy.
            Honestly, we are not going crazy… It's just menopause!

            Menopause is a transitional period when our bodies start to wind down on our reproductive abilities.

            And it is no fun ride. All the mood swings, hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, joint pains, and the never-ending
            list of problems. Feels like we have a lot to deal with, by ourselves.
